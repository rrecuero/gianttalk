Thank you Jonathan. 
First of all, we are really glad to have you here. 
Welcome! My name is Ramon and I am a Lead engineer here at Moz, that as you may know, is the online marketing leader in SEO.  Not so long ago, I found myself in the same position you are now. 4 years ago, I was in Chicago working as a developer for a mid size company, boring job from 9 to 5. I attended a startup weekend without knowing exactly what to expect. It was an awesome experience that introduced me to a new world, startups.

Developing a prototype, getting to know the startup ecosystem, learning from mentors and most importantly meeting other entrepreneurs in such short time is a really unique experience. Try to make the most out fo it. You never know when you are going to meet that person that is going to make the difference for you career or your business. Personally, during that weekend I met my cofounder. Crazily, Two months later we were creating a company and we were admitted into a incubator.

It is also really interesting for me that this startup weekend is focused on Latin American Markets. We all know it's an emerging economy with some challenges, yes, but amazing opportunities as well. Some of these countries have even worked really hard to build a startup network and have succeeded, Startup Chile program is a great example of this.From my point of view, Latin America is the biggest market outside North America when it comes to startups. It may be a bit still abit immature, but the ecosystem is growing and ripe for innovation. And here is where you come in.

We are all really excited to see what you can build during this weekend, and I am looking forward to your demo pitches on Sunday.

Good luck to everyone :)
