						Thank you. It's an honor to be here.

						So 5 years ago I graduated on CS. I had been waiting all my life for that moment, finally I was able to 
						build rad products and create exciting experiences for users. To get there, I thought getting a full time job
						was my only option. I took a full time job and I was really eager to start, I had all these ideas and I am going to make 
						this big impact on the world.

						Sounds familiar? Within 4 months, I wanted to bash my head against the wall of my cubicle. But I didn't know exactly why.
						The job was fine, I was good at it and I was working on technologies I liked... I didn't realize what was missing until
						one of my friends asked me a simple question. Ramon, Why are you doing the work you are doing? 

						That did it, I was beig complacent, on the paycheck, on the security and I stopped learning, I stopped being who I wanted to become. Next morning I decided to quit. I realised and reassured myself that the only real job for me would be one where I get new challenges every day and I follow my passion. Once place that allows me to be in permanent beta.

						Permanent Beta is Netflix internal motto. It means that you are never finished, never done. It applies to products but it also applies to your own career and even to your life.

						For life in permanent beta, every success, every failure, every career oportunity is a door, an opportunity to adapt your current life to what you want or who you want to become. The trick is that you are never done with it, you are always in beta, there are always new things to learn, new places to go and new milestones to reach...

						Or like Jim Rohn says, "Do not linger more than one year in a grade of learning".

						(Reid Hoffman, plan A,B, Z)

						For the next few minutes, I am going to try to illustrate my journey following this philosophy through my few succeses and many failures.

						So, less than 6 months since I started that job I was telling you about, I quit. And obviously, I found myself at a crossroads. 

						It was a new start, but a new start of what? The only thing I knew is that I had this desire of building something great, rad, from scratch, that could touch the lives of many people. So what to do?

					<aside class="notes">
						 I had this really unique and original idea!! Let's build a startup, change the world and get rich. Yeah, I know, I know, I was probably watching the social network way too many times.

						 A Startup is the canonical example of permanent beta, you have limited resources, so you need to keep iterating, adpating every day to reach value. If you become complacent, there is now ay you are going to be able to compete with companies that are ten times your size and have more resources than you. You can't sit on your chair and rest on past work because there isn't any.
				  </aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<image width='800'

					<aside class="notes">
						But I still had a problem!! I needed an idea!
						From my point of view, there is only possible source for an startup idea, passion. You are going to have to work on it countless hours for little money, so make damn sure that you love it or otherwise you'll hate it really soon.

						The only reason to start a startup is when you just can't help yourself. There is something driving you that you can't stop. In my case, I grew up watching movies with my brother and were constantly asking each other questions about Star Wars and LOTR and fighting to find out who knew the most. I was so passionate about beating my brother and proving it that I wanted to build a company around it. A platform where everyone could create games about their favorite topics and compete with their friends.

					<image width='800' src='images/family.jpg'>
					<aside class="notes">
						So now I had an idea but there wasn't any time to rest, now I needed the most important component for building a great product and a great startup: the team.

						Let's me reiterate this. Your team is the most important component of a startup. More than the idea. I believe that a great team, even starting with the wrong idea can pivot and get to product market fit eventually. But the opposite is not true.

						Luckily, I had some connections and friends I made during my master's degree. They all had suffered me playing trivia nights so it wasn't difficult t show them how passionate I was about the product.

						Founding a team is actually a lot similar like funding a family. You are going to spend more time with them than with your friends, father, mother or even your girlfriend or boyfriend.

						In a startup there is only you and your team. So your team needs to do everything from marketing to pitching, customer support, development or sales. If you are not going to do it, nobody else is going to do it. You are the last line of defence. Being in the trenches every day working together and trying to move this huge rock, creates a huge feeling of belonging and camaradery that is really difficult to replicate.

					<aside class="notes">
						Now that we had an idea and a team, we started working.
						We had no idea of what we were getting into. 

						We quickly ran into two unexpected enemies: pressure and uncertainty.
				  </aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<image width='1000' 
						src='images/uncertainty.jpg'>
					<aside class="notes">
						"Walking on water and creating products from requirements are both easy if both are frozen."
						Startups are the opposite of having clear requirements. As Eric Ries likes to say, they are created under extreme uncertainty. So the only way to find out where the value is and what the customers want is to get things done quicker and get them as fast as you can to the public so you can learn from them. It is really similar to permanent beta. You can't sit on your coach and expect the users to get to your site and figure out things to improve it. You need to drive that change. You can spend 6 months in your garage writing perfect code and then you try to get it out and you probably realize that nobody wants it.
				  </aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<image width='1000' 
						src='images/startups.png'>
					<aside class="notes">
						Then, the pressure.

						We felt this huge external pressure that was like a heavy rock over our shoulders.
						Its interesting, society and media in particular tend succesful startups like twitter or facebook but they rearely talk about failed startups. So it's only natural than most people have a non realistic view of what's a startup. It is really important that you understand and that you are aware of this pressure.

						Funny enough, every founder feels the same way and every time you ask them how is your startup doing? Great, we are growing X % and we are talking with many clients and so on.... There is this huge pressure to look like you are the next airbnb and founders always project this appearance that everything is going great.
				  </aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<image width='800' src='images/success.jpg'>
					<aside class="notes">
						I thought I was the worst CEO in history. I had no idea about how to deal with this pressure. Every day, I had countless decisions to make, from competing features, to pitching decks to hiring. I felt that I was the only CEO that had no clue of what I was doing.
						
						When you hear stories like facebook or twitter in the media, you tend to believe that everything was a straight line, when in reality it looks more like this. Startups are hard. In fact hard doesn't even begin to cover it, but I'll add more on that later.

						What did I do? Applying Permanent beta, every day start new things and never settle with the current status quo of the product.I just tried to make the best decision every day with the uncertainity that you never have complete information at a startup.

					<aside class="notes">
						After working really hard for several months, Netgamix was born. Netgamix was a platform where everyone could create trivia games about their favorite topics and share them with their friends. 

						After more months of hard work, we reached some kind of success. We were admitted into an incubator.

						...Some incubator stories.

						Then we got investment 150K.

					<aside class="notes">
						This picture summarizes how it felt!! It felt like success, but was it? Receiving investment is not the end goal for a startup, it's just the beginning.

						We lost track of the end goal, we stopped being frugal, we got too distracted with the future, conferences and other external activities.

						After all these apparent succeses, we became complacent. Growth slowed down, revenue didn't raise and we started running out of money. One of my cofounders quit. We worked on the wrong things, distracted by media attention and the investments.

					<q style='clear:both'>When you are in the Struggle, nothing feels right</q>
					<p>Ben Horowitz - Hard things about hard things</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						And then the struggle came.
						Your own psychology is probably the hardest thing to manage at a startup.
						It's exactly what Ben Horowitz talks about in his book. He talks about how when you start your company with a clear vision
						of how success looks like. You are going to create an amazing company with the smartest people, build a great product and make the world a bit better.

						After working day and night, you realize things are not going as planned. The market isn't quite what you thought it would be. Your employees are losing confidence and some quit. You are running low on cash. You lose a loyal customer and walls start closing in. Then you find yourself in the struggle. The struggle is when you wonder why you started the company in the first place. The struggle is when people ask you why you don't quit and you don't know the answer. The struggle is when don't believe you should be CEO of your company. The struggle is when you go on vacation to feel better and you feel worse.

						In summary, when you are in the struggle nothing is easy and nothing feels right.

				<section>
					<image width='800' src='images/birdman.jpg'>
					<aside class="notes">
						I got a bit depressed about the delays and the challenges of being bigger and failure to meet the
						expectations. I started to feel the burden of the cash running out, I felt I let my team down. They trusted me and basically worked for peanuts for a couple of years and I failed them.
						That’s the story I had to listen to sometimes. We all have this dark version of ourselves that creeps out to tell us that
						we can't do something. And even though a smarter, more logical, more mature version of me could have poked that story full of holes, once you are in the loop, as Rand Fishkin calls it, it's difficult to get out of it and the voice creeps out to re-tell that story.

					<h3> Let's talk about failure </h3>
					<aside class="notes">
						Runway was only around 2 months and although our user base showed potential we couldn't monetize it well enough so we decided to move on.

						But was really Netgamix a failure? It definitely felt like it but it depends how you look at it. Did we exit? Hell no. But it was probably the job that made the biggest impact on our lives, both personally and profesionally. Every time I see my cofounders I feel appreciation when I was fearful and expecting disappointment and regret.

						Funny thing, how time can change perception. Now when me and my cofounders look back we all treasure those moments working together. Thanks to that experience we all learned a lot about how startups and businesses operate, things you usually don't get to learn at a normal job, 

						We got to apply permanent beta, being in a startup with great people is an unique and amazing experience that is going to make you grow every day.

						So, here I was again. One path ended and I found myself at the crossroads for a second time. Instead of dwelling on the closed door, I had to start again. Adapting to the new situation and thinking in terms of all the possibilities ahead of me I felt something like optimism.
						What to do now? After reflecting on myself, I knew I wanted to work closer to the game industry but with a startup mentality. At the same time earn some solid income because I needed to repay some of the debts I got while I was starting the company.
						One week before closing the company, I got a phone call from Zynga.
						I always loved Web applications and games so working for the biggest player in the market that just Ipoed seemed perfect.

						Right? The day I start, the stock tanks 70%. Change can happens anytime in a matter of months, days
						or even minutes.
						Besides the stock, it was an amazing experience, during my time there, I worked on a match 3 game that reached millions of monthly users. It was a work hard/ play hard environment. It shared some tings in common with what I experienced in my own startup like high pressure, accountability and tight teams. But it had a lot of differences that I had to adapt to.

						Everything was fine and stable right? 2 months after releasing the game, the company closed our Seattle office.
						So where I was again? Here. Again, instead of regret the closure of the office and dwell on the great experiences shared that were gone forever. I looked at the endless posibilities ahead of me. I gained  a lot of knowledge of things
						I wanted for my next position (startup mentality, fun environment, great mentors...) and things that I didn't like crunching, long working hours...
						If you think about it, compared to 30 years ago, careers are really volatile, it is really rare to see employees work all their lives for the same employer. But I believe this is a good thing, every couple years we have a chance to adapt and get closer to where we want to be.

						So as Mike Tyson said,"everyone had a plan until they get punched in the face." I think that's true in business as well,
						in your career and even in your life. You need to adapt, you need to stay at the edge of your comfort zone. Everyone is going to get punches, the difference relies in your flexibility and adaptability to new situations.

					<aside class="notes">
						To wrap up, keep in mind that no path guarantee success, no matter what you choose. Just remember, you are never done.
						Don't settle down, never stop learning, every day there are endless opportunities waiting for you.
						Take every success and more important every failure, as an opportunity to reassess, and steer your life in the direction
						you want. Don't be afraid to take risks, embrace them!

						For life in permanent beta, the trick is to never stop starting.
						Thank you very much!
