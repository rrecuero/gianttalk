						Thank you. It's an honor to be here.

						So, 5 years ago I completed my degree on CS.  As many others, I had been waiting all my life for that moment, I had all these dreams, these ideas that I wanted to turn into products that make a big impact in the world. So I was really eager to start my first job. A first job that would give me 
						the opportunity to accomplish all this, right? 
						Then, of course I faced reality...

					<aside class="notes">
						Within 4 months, I wanted to bash my head against the wall of my cubicle. And the worst part was I didn't even know why.
						The job was fine, I was ok at it and I was working on technologies I liked... But something was missing you know? I didn't realize what it was until
						one of my friends asked me a simple question. Ramon, Why are you doing the work you are doing? 

						That did it, I realised was being complacent, on the paycheck, on job security and I stopped learning, I stopped improving, I stopped attempting to be who I wanted to become. Next morning I decided to quit. I realised and reassured myself that the only real job for me would be one where I get new challenges every day. Once place that allows me to be in permanent beta.

						Permanent Beta is Netflix internal motto. It means that you are never finished, never done, always a work in progress. It applies to products but it also applies to your own career and even to your life.

						For life in permanent beta, every success, every failure, every career oportunity is a door, a chance to adapt your current life to what you want do or who you want to become. The trick, again, is simple, is that you are never done with it, you are always in beta, there are always new things to learn, new places to go and new milestones to reach...

						Or like Jim Rohn says, "Do not linger more than one year in a grade of learning".

						For the next few minutes, I am going to talk about several moments of my career to try to illustrate this philosphy.

						So, after quitting my job I found myself at a crossroads. 

						It was a new start, but a new start of what? Honestly, I had no idea. The only thing I knew is that I had this desire of building something great, rad, from scratch, that could touch the lives of many people. So what to do?

							A million dollars isn't cool. You know what's cool? 
							<br> A Billion dollars
						</q>
					</div>
					<aside class="notes">
						 I had this really unique and original idea!! Let's build a startup, change the world and get rich. Right? Yeah, I know, I know, I was probably watching the social network way too many times.

						 A Startup is the canonical example of permanent beta, you have limited resources, so you need to keep iterating, adpating every day to reach value. If you become complacent, there is no way you are going to be able to compete with companies that are ten times your size and have way more resources than you. You can't sit on your chair and rest on past work because there isn't any.
				  </aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<image width='800' 
						src='images/mark.png'>
					<aside class="notes">
						But I still had a problem!! I needed an idea!
						From my point of view, there is only possible source for an startup idea, passion. You are going to have to work on it countless hours for little money, so make damn sure that you love it or otherwise you'll hate it really soon.

						The only reason to start a startup is when you just can't help yourself. There is something driving you that you can't stop. In my case, I grew up watching movies with my brother and were constantly asking each other questions about Star Wars and LOTR and fighting to find out who knew the most. I was so passionate about beating my brother and proving it that I wanted to build a company around it. A platform where everyone could create games about their favorite topics and compete with their friends.

					<image width='800' src='images/family.jpg'>
					<aside class="notes">
						So now I had an idea but there wasn't any time to rest, now I needed the most important component for building a great product and a great startup: the team.

						Let's me repeat this. Your team is the most important component of a startup. For me, even more than the idea. I believe that a great team, even starting with the wrong idea can pivot and get to build a great company eventually. These happened to companies like Paypal or AIrbnb. But the opposite is not true.

						Founding a team is actually a lot similar like funding a family. You are going to spend more time with them than with your friends, father, mother or even your girlfriend or boyfriend.

						In a startup there is only you and your team. So your team needs to do everything from design, marketing to pitching, customer support, development or sales. You need to adapt to these sitations. If you are not going to do it, nobody else is going to do it.

						Luckily, I had some connections and friends I made during my master's degree. They all had suffered me playing trivia nights at bars so it wasn't difficult to show them how passionate I was about the idea.
				  </aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<image width='800' src='images/goliath.jpg'>
					<aside class="notes">
						Now that we had an idea and a team, we started working.
						We had no idea of what we were getting into. 

						We quickly ran into two unexpected enemies: pressure and uncertainty.
				  </aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<image width='1000' 
						src='images/uncertainty.jpg'>
					<aside class="notes">
						There is this saying that: "Walking on water and creating products from requirements are both easy if both are frozen."
						Startups are the opposite of having clear requirements. As Eric Ries likes to say, they are created under extreme uncertainty. So the only way to find out where the value is and what the customers want is to get things done quicker and get them as fast as you can to the public so you can learn from them. It is really similar to permanent beta. You can't sit on your couch and expect the users to magically get to your site (Build it and they will come) and then also figure out things to improve it. You need to drive that change.
				  </aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<image width='1000' 
						src='images/startups.png'>
					<aside class="notes">
						Then, the pressure.

						We felt this huge external pressure that was like a heavy rock over our shoulders.
						Its interesting, society and media in particular tend to cover succesful startups like twitter or facebook but they rarely talk about failed startups. So it's only natural than most people have a non realistic view of what's a startup. Most of your friends and probably even your family are never going to understand what you are doing .Even the ones that do are going to ask you every time they see you, so you already got 10 thousand million of users or are you a millionaire already?. . It is really important that you understand and that you are aware of this pressure.

						Funny enough, every founder feels the same way. You have probably ran into some founders that every time you ask them how is your startup doing? Great, we are growing X % and we are talking with many clients and so on.... There is this huge pressure to look like you are the next airbnb or the next uber and founders always project this appearance that everything is going great.
				  </aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<image width='800' src='images/success.jpg'>
					<aside class="notes">
						Because of this pressure and because I didn't know any better. I thought I was the worst founder in history. I had no idea about how to deal with this. Every day, I had countless decisions to make, from competing features, to pitching decks to hiring. I felt that I was the only founder that had no clue of what he is doing.
						
						Because when you hear stories like google in the media, you tend to believe that everything was a straight line. Larry page had everything figured out right? When in reality it looks more like this. Startups are really hard. Even the most succesful ones were really close to failure several times.

						What did we do? Apply Permanent beta, every day start new things and never settle with the current status quo of the product. We just tried to make the best decision every day knowing that we didn't have all the information.

					<aside class="notes">
						After working really hard for several months, Netgamix was born. Netgamix was a platform where everyone could create trivia games about their favorite topics and share them with their friends. 

						A couple months after we release, we reached some kind of milestone. We were admitted into an incubator. These incubators give you office space, mentorship and a chance to meet angel investors and VC.
						At the end of the program, three months later, we got investment 150K.

					<p> Celebrate the right things</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						You can probably imagine how we felt.
						This picture doesn't even come close to it. It felt like success. Yes! We finally did it, right? Not quite. Unfortunately, receiving investment is not the end goal for a startup, it's just the beginning.

						But we lost track of this, we stopped being frugal, we stopped adapting, we became complacent. Growth slowed down, revenue didn't raise and we started running out of money. We worked on the wrong things, distracted by media attention and the investments. On top of that, one of the cofounders quit

					<q style='clear:both'>When you are in the Struggle, nothing feels right</q>
					<p>Ben Horowitz - Hard things about hard things</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						The pressure got unbearable and the struggle came.
						Your own psychology is probably the hardest thing to manage,
						in your life and at a startup.
						It's exactly what Ben Horowitz talks about in his book. He talks about how when you start your company you do it with a clear vision
						of how success looks like. You are going to create an amazing company with the smartest people, build a great product and make the world a bit better.

						After working day and night, you realize things are not going as planned. The market isn't quite what you thought it would be. Your employees are losing confidence, some are quitting. You are running low on cash. You lose a loyal customer and walls start closing in and you find yourself in the struggle. The struggle is when you wonder why you started the company in the first place. I was there. People asked me you why you don't quit and I didn't know the answer, I couldn't come up with one. I didn't even believe I should be founder of my own company. 

						In summary, when you are in the struggle nothing is easy and nothing feels right.
				  </aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<image width='800' src='images/birdman.jpg'>
					<aside class="notes">
						I got a bit depressed. The delays and the challenges of being bigger and failure to meet the
						expectations got to me. I started to feel the burden of the cash running out. Most importantly, I felt I let my team down. They trusted me and basically worked for nothing for a couple of years and I failed them.
						That’s the story I had to listen to sometimes. We all have this dark version of ourselves that appears to tell us that
						we can't do something. And even though a more relaxed, more experienced version of me could have seen reality, once you are in the struggle also known as loop, it's difficult to get out of it and the voice reappears to re-tell that story again and again.

				<section>
					<h3> Let's talk about failure </h3>
					<aside class="notes">
						Runway was only around 2 months and although our user base showed potential we couldn't monetize it well enough so we decided to move on.

						But was really Netgamix a failure? It depends how you look at it. Did we exit? no. And I remember that day telling my cofounder this, I was expecting regret and disappointment but instead I just felt appreciation. It was probably the job that made the biggest impact on our lives, both personally and profesionally.

						Now when me and my cofounders look back we all treasure those moments working together. Thanks to that experience we all learned a lot about how startups and businesses operate, things you usually don't get to learn at a normal job.

						We got to apply permanent beta, adapting to many problems every day.
				  </aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<image src='images/crossroads.jpg'>
					<aside class="notes">
						So, here I was again. One path ended and I found myself at the crossroads for a second time. Instead of dwelling on the failure, I had to start again. Now, more than ever I had to apply permanent beta. So I focused on the possibilities ahead of me and for the first time in months, I felt something like optimism.
						What to do now? After reflecting on myself, I knew I wanted to work closer to the game industry to learn from the inside
						how it works but I also knew I wanted to keep several thinks similar to how they were in a startup.
						One week after closing the company, I got a phone call from Zynga. At the time, the company was booming thanks to Farmville. I always loved Web applications and games so working for the biggest player in the market that just Ipoed seemed perfect.

					<aside class="notes">
						Right? The day I start, the stock tanks 70%. Change can happens anytime in a matter of months, days
						or even minutes.
						Besides the stock dip, it was an amazing experience.. It was a work hard/ play hard environment. It shared some tings in common with what I experienced in my own startup like high pressure, accountability and tight teams. But it had a lot of differences that I had to adapt to.

					<aside class="notes">
						Like working on the same product for a long time. We developed a popular match 3 game similar to Candy Crush. It took
						us almost two years. Two years that were filled

					<image src='images/zynga2.jpg'>
					<aside class="notes">
						with lot of hard work. We definitely crunched, even had a few sleepless nights working but curiosly enough,
						 we didn't mind it as much because we were having a lot of fun.

						Ping Pong. Every one knows a good tech company needs to have
						a ping pong table. And you need to be good at it. I got
						good enough
				  </aside>

				<section>
					<image src='images/zynga6.jpg'>
					<aside class="notes">
						and we even mixed Ping Pong and Alcohol. Don't ask me why

				<section>
					<image src='images/thereandback.jpg'>
					<aside class="notes">
						Everything was finally perfect right? 2 months after releasing the game, the company closed our Seattle office.
						If you think about it, compared to 30 years ago, careers are really volatile, it is really rare to see employees work all their lives for the same employer. But I believe this is a good thing, every couple years we have a chance to adapt and get closer to where we want to be.

					<aside class="notes">
						So as Mike Tyson said,"everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face." I think that's true in business as well,
						in your career and even in your life. You need to adapt, you need to stay at the edge of your comfort zone. Everyone is going to get punches, the difference relies in how resilient you are and well you can adapt to this.
				  </aside>

					<q>The day you stop looking is the day you die</q>
					<p>Al Pacino - Scent of a Woman</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						To wrap up, keep in mind that no path guarantee success, no matter what you choose. Just remember, you are never done.
						Don't settle down, don't stop learning, every day there are endless opportunities waiting for you. Don't be afraid to take risks, embrace them!
						Take every success and more importantly every failure, as an opportunity to evaluate, and steer your life in the direction
						you want. 

						For life in permanent beta, the trick is to never stop starting.
						Thank you very much!
